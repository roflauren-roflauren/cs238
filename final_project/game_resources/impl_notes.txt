gameplay elements: 
    1. worth fiddling arround with self.attack_cooldown and self.parry_cooldown (and self.action_cooldown) in fighter.py; 
    a totally random AI can spam attacks very quickly making it nontrivial to defeat it!
    2. maybe change the parry rect width to make parrying a little less difficult? right now it's set at 2 * self.rect.width which is pretty okay
    3. maybe increase attack, parry, action cooldown if gameplay agent is AI?

hyperparameters as constants locations: 
    - 'NUM_HIDDEN_NODES' in 'dqn.py'
    - round win reward penalty/addendum in 'game.py''s step() function

to-do's: 
    1. in fighter.py: 
        1.1. write get_state function 
        1.2. write parse_keys_from_action_idx function
    2. check to make sure demo.py works as intended 
    3. begin filling out trainer.py's 'train' function!
