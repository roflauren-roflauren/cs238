 # rule: given a topological sort S (s_0,...,s_{n-1}) of graph g, if you want to reverse the edge (s_i, s_j) where i < j, 
    # then for each index k from i to j-1, if (s_k, s_j) in edges(g), (s_k, s_j) must also be flipped. here, since we want to flip 
    # at most one edge, we can keep track of how many edges we would need to flip if (s_i, s_j) were to flip, and if this quantity > 0, don't flip that edge.
